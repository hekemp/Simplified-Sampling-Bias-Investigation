# Simplified Sampling Bias Investigation
A Shiny R application that allows students to learn more sampling bias by drawing samples from a population of baboons under varying conditions.

Note: This is the simplified version of the final sampling bias investigation app. The final version of the app has the ability for students to select their own biases by removing points on their own.
